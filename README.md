# path_test
My first pathfinding algorithm

I managed to write a pathfinding system without watching any direct coding tutorials on how to do it. All I've really 
done before codeing this, is watch a video on how pathfinding algorithms generally work and figured out the rest. It
wasn't easy though, this is probably the most lines of code I've written into a project so far.

I've also went about doing a different script structure than normal. Personally I think it looks better.

CONTROLS: 
- Click a tile to add/remove a wall.
- Right click to place/move the target tile
- Press the Space key and watch the magic happen!

The reason I went ahead to do this is because I figured that knowing how to do pathfinding is one of those things that 
are necessary to making most games. Along with animations, spritesheets, serialization, and the works. Hopefully I can
write a more efficient system in the future, so what do you think?

Thanks for checking this out!
